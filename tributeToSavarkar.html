    <h3 id="">Kaala Pani: The Hell on Earth</h3>

    <p id="para">In 1911, freedom fighter Savarkar was sentenced to 50 years in the cellular jail of Andamans (also known as Kala Pani) for revolting against the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Indian-Councils-Act-of-1909" id="anchorId"> Morley-Minto reforms</a>.He was severely tortured in the Jail.The jailor’s punishments were terrible, banishing prisoners to the living Hell of the oil mills. In the morning prisoners would join a queue to be allocated a punishing work quota, the results of which would be scrutinised at the end of the day. If they failed to meet this quota they would be beaten or whipped.They were given the job of endlessly pounding coconut husks to be used as fibre in certain fabrics, all under the watch of guards.They were expected to produce 30 pounds of oil a day, a huge amount that most were unable to complete in one work session.This was their insane punishment.</p>

     <p id="para">But his national freedom spirit continued and there he started teaching his fellow prisoners to read and write. He also took permission from the government to begin a basic library in the prison. He was released in 1924.</p>
